# Employee Salary Analysis Project Readme

## Overview

The Employee Salary Analysis project aims to explore and understand salary distribution patterns within a company, specifically focusing on gender-based differences. The project involves analyzing the salary data of male and female employees across various departments to identify trends and potential disparities.

## Project Structure

- **Data Folder:**
  - Contains the dataset used for analysis (`HR Dataset.csv`).
  
- **Workbook:**
  - `Gender Salary differences analysis.xlsx`: Excel workbook contain ordered data, pivot table and observation report.

## Instructions for Running the Analysis

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gauravmazumdar21/Gender-Salary-Differences-Analysis.git
   
## Observation
- **Gender Distribution:**
The company has a higher percentage of female employees (57%) compared to male employees (43%).

- **Salary Distribution:**
Despite females being the majority, there are instances where males draw higher salaries.
In three departments, females draw higher salaries, while in three other departments, males draw higher salaries.

- **Overall Salary Average:**
The total average salary for male employees is higher than that for female employees.

- **Salary Discrepancies:**
  - It's noteworthy that in the departments where females draw higher salaries, the number of male employees may be less, which could contribute to the higher average salary for males.
  - Conversely, in departments where males draw higher salaries, the larger number of female employees may not compensate for the higher individual male salaries.
