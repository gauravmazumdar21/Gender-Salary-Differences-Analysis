- **Salary Distribution:**
Despite females being the majority, there are instances where males draw higher salaries.
In three departments, females draw higher salaries, while in three other departments, males draw higher salaries.

- **Overall Salary Average:**
The total average salary for male employees is higher than that for female employees.

- **Salary Discrepancies:**
  - It's noteworthy that in the departments where females draw higher salaries, the number of male employees may be less, which could contribute to the higher average salary for males.
  - Conversely, in departments where males draw higher salaries, the larger number of female employees may not compensate for the higher individual male salaries.
